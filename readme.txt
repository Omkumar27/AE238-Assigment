
         Airfoil Analysis - ReadMe

This script is designed to analyze an airfoil by computing its camber line, camber slope, velocity field, circulation, and aerodynamic coefficients such as the lift coefficient (Cl) and moment coefficient (Cm). It also provides graphical representations of these aerodynamic properties.

The user needs to provide specific inputs to successfully run the script.


        How to Use the Code


Step 1: As we have provided the Ipython notebook. Just click Run time tab you will see options in that click on Run all cells.


This will install:
- `numpy`: For numerical computations
- `matplotlib`: For generating plots
- `scipy`: For scientific computing functions
- `sympy`: For symbolic mathematics


Step 2: Providing User Inputs
Once the script starts running, it will prompt you to enter the following inputs:

1. Maximum Camber (m): This represents the maximum height of the camber line in meters.
2. Position of Maximum Camber (p): This is the fraction of the chord length where the maximum camber occurs (typically between 0 and 1).
3. Angle of Attack (alpha): The angle at which the airflow meets the airfoil, measured in degrees.
4. Free Stream Velocity (U_fs): The velocity of the incoming airflow in meters per second (m/s).

Example Input:



Step 3: Understanding the Output
Once the script processes the input, it will generate the following:
1. Graphical Outputs
- Camber Line Plot: A plot showing the camber line of the airfoil.
- Camber Slope Plot: A plot illustrating how the slope of the camber changes along the airfoil.
- Velocity Vector Field: A quiver plot showing velocity vectors around the airfoil.

These plots will open in separate windows. 

2. Numerical Outputs
- Lift Coefficient (Cl): This value quantifies the lift force generated by the airfoil.
- Moment Coefficient (Cm): A measure of the pitching moment about the aerodynamic center.
- Circulation (Î“): The circulation around the airfoil, which contributes to lift generation.

These values will be displayed in the terminal as follows:
